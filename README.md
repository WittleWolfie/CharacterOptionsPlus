# Character Options+

Adds character build options from the tabletop ruleset.

### This mod creates a save dependency. Once you save with this mod enabled it must remain enabled or you will lose access to the save.

## Problems or Suggestions

File a [bug](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [feature request](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D). You can also reach me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) in the #mod-user-general channel.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (min v0.23)
2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Character Options+
3. Click "Install"
    * If you don't have [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) already, install them using ModFinder

I also recommend installing [TabletopTweaks-Base](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and [TabletopTweaks-Reworks](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Reworks). They are not required but I developed the mod using them and there may bugs if you use it without them.

If you do not want to use ModFinder, download [CharacterOptionsPlus.*.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/releases/latest) and install it using Unity Mod Manager. Make sure to install [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) as well.

## Base Game Changes

* Evasion is available as a Slayer Advanced Talent

## Bug Fixes

* Heavenly Fire can be used 3 + Charisma Modifier times per day instead of just 3
* Serpent's Fang poison DC is calculated correctly
* Serpent Friend grants +3 to Perception instead of +2, matching the feature description

### Mod Options

![Mod options screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus/blob/main/screenshots/settings.png)

This mod uses [Mod Menu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu), settings are in the game settings: Settings > Mods > Character Options+. They are not available in UMM.

All settings changes require a restart to take effect.

You can use options to disable any feature added. This will:

* Prevent the feature from being selectable
* Remove any effect from the feature
* Remove any changes to existing mechanics

This will not:

* Remove the feature from characters (but it will not work)
* Grant a replacement feature for characters who have it
